Day 59 13 Jan - Rice Island -> Tire Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0633
  Planted yucca is ready for harvest
  I'm heading off from Rice.  Going to the SW most island.

  1042
  Landed on new island, clearing of dangerous animals now
  Killed two crabs.  You can spear them in the face, but it will break if it hits their back.  Remember to bring the axe on you next time.

  1435
  Harvest palm saplings

  1730
  Done with harvest - got 39

  1800
  sunset
  I'm going to build a water station next.

  1930
  The moon is high enough to see OK.

  2100
  New water still, drank it empty.  How long until it is full?
  There are not a lot of palm saplings, so we're going to use the palm tree tops.

  I'm going to cut down all the trees first.  It's easy to do them in the dark.

  2315
  All the trees are down except one palm.  This is a good way to mark that I've
  been somewhere.  If we need coconuts, that one tree may provide.

  I'm pretty hungry.  I'll need to cook those crabs so I can get something aside from coconut.

Day 60 14 Jan - Tire Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0115
  The water now is full.  So it makes about 1/hour.
  I gathered 12 tree tops.  Probably 15 on the island.

0600 sunrise

0700
  I'm going to gather all the plants and rocks I can find.

0945
  1 potato
  2 ajuga
  2 pipi
  2 aloe

1245
  Let's time to get all the trees.  Once the weather clears up, we can survey for new islands.

1520
  Got 21 logs.  I dropped one point to my previous island, Rice, 0deg.

1700
  The sun is about to go down.  What should I do next?
  I still need to name the island.
  I need to start farms.  They take a while.  To do that, we need a plank
  machine.  Let's see if we can whip one up while the night comes in.

1945
  Planted kura

2100
  planted potato
  Now that we're planting, we need another water still.

DAY 61 - Tire Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0530
  There don't seem to be any ill effects to staying up all night, so I'm going to keep doing it.

  I've got all the goodies around the island picked up.

  Tomorrow, I'll get some yuca plots growing.

  0745
  I can't get into the boat on shore.  I need to pull mine out to get into it.

  1700
  palm saplings are ready
  They take 48 hours to regenerate.

  It's about to be dark, so I'll harvest them in the morning.

  We will call this, Tire Island.

# Measurements
  * 0   short distance, Rice Island
  * 30  far
  * 280 medium (next target)


  2200
  I'm going to take the boat out to get in that beached boat.  I don't want it to float away, though, so I need an anchor.

Day 62 - Tire Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0630
  I found barrels and more tape.  Time to harvest the palm saplings!

1000
Done harvesting palm saplings

1430
  I positioned the boat so it's pointing at the next island.  I'm burning up
    again.  If I use aloe, how long does it last?  Do I need more every day?
  I took some aloe potion.  I know the effect won't last forever, but is there
    a secret effect?  Will I need it again tomorrow?  It cost 2 aloe plants.

1830
  I've discovered rocks continue to respawn.

2045
  I'm getting itchy to get to the next island.  Before we go, I need to

# Before launch
  * get axe in hand
  * note how long it takes my garden items to grow
  * gather tools

2130
  Kura fruit harvested (planted 48 hours ago)
  Potato harvested (planted 48 hours ago)
  So garden items take 48 hours to grow.
  There is little point it me carrying around a bunch of seeds.  I should
  always keep one of each on hand and only eat from the garden.

2330
  I don't have any leather and have not had luck hunting sharks from shore.
    I'm thinking of creating a spear gun now that we have two rolls of duct
    tape.  What else is duct tape used for?

  duct tape: raft motor, spear gun
  air canister: spear gun, deep dives

Day 63 - Tire Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0246
  I've created a spear gun.  Hunting shark at first light!  I am going to sleep.

0515
  wake up - Do I always wake at this time?

0615
  finally light, into the water!

1015
  Got a hammerhead near the deeper boat.  There's a deeply sunken boat
  further out.  It took 4 shots to kill.  I missed one and got it with the
  axe.  I got poisoned and beat up pretty badly.  If it takes 4 arrows, I need to carry 8.

1130
  My yucca plants are ready.  Harvested.

1230
  I need aloe again.  How long has it been?  1 day.

1800
  I've been trying to hunt hammerhead in the water.  It's not working.  I've shot them many times, but they don't die.  I need to go back to hunting from the boat.
  Do I need leather before I carry on?  I'll heal up tonight, gather my stuff, relax tomorrow, then head to the next island on day 65.
  280 medium (next target)


Day 64 - Tire Island -> Bat Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0045
  I just had to chase my raft 60 strokes out to sea.  Whoops.  Remember to drag it in better.

0400
  landed - I forgot to note the time I left.  Probably 0130.

0800
  Animals cleared, 2 crabs, one giant boar, 1 snake, 1 piglet still running around

0930
  Shelter made and saved.  What's the first thing we need?  Water we have from
  coconuts.  Food from coconuts and murdered animals.  Fire is easy.  Plants
  take 48 hours to grow.  Maybe start with a quick palm sapling harvest, then
  make fire and cook an animal.  Then water still.

## Plan
  * palm saplings
  * fire, cook animal
  * water still
  * trees
  * planks
  * farms

1000
  harvest palm saplings

1415
  done harvesting palm saplings

1500
  had to use aloe potion, no time to goof in the water

1615
  crab cooking

1830
  water still ready

1900
  ate large cooked crab and drank a coconut
  How long does it take to cook a large crab?
  It's night now.  Good time to chop down all the trees!

2245
  All pine saplings and palm trees are down.  Next is planks, but I need to
  craft some for that.  Also, that will use up my axe.  I need the axe to chop
  logs, so I'll do that.  It's also easier at night.  I'll leave the palm tops
  for later.
  If you chop the logs first, it takes 3 to separate from the palm
  top, then 3 for each segment of log.  Instead, start with chopping the top.
  2 to remove the top, then 3 for each log segment.


Day 65 - Bat Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0100
  My axe was used up.

0500
  Almost done harvesting logs.  It's occurred to me that it wastes time running
  back and forth.  I should just cut them all, then come back and carry.
  The sun is coming up.  Did I mark where I came from correctly?
  280 got me here from Tire Island.
  280 + 180 = 460
  460 - 360 = 100 That should point back from whence I came. Yep, confirmed.

0645
  Time to start on the plank station.

0800
  Plank station done.  I had to use up my axe and create a new hammer.  Before
  heading off to the next island, ensure I have extras.
  Dang.  I forgot my hoe.

## Launch Checklist
  * 2 cheap hammers
  * 1 hoe
  * 2 refined axes (one in belt)
  * 4 lashings
  * 2 aloe potions
  * water bladder

0900
  Hoes are really easy to make.

0930
  I planted a spoiled kura and potato from my boxes.  Seeds should stay in the
    boxes.  I should only eat out of the garden.  I want the other fruit.  It
    may be on this island.  I'll check it out before planting more.  Until the
    farms are all planted, I'm going to drink coconuts instead of the still.
    Once I get a few more farms up, I'll get another water still to help water
    them.

## Plan
  * create several more farms (1 for each crop)
  * plant
  * create another water still
  * water all farms

1030
  I built for more farms.  What will we put in them?
  Aloe seems to be in-demand. 2 aloe
  Breathboost not so much
  I've got a lot of Pipi.
  I'm going to do 2 aloe and then check to see what that fruit in the forest is.
  Sweet.  It's a quwawa.  That's going in the ground.
  I accidentally ate it.  :(  Restart.  Good thing I saved after building the farms.

1130
  I ended up with
  * quwqwq
  * kura
  * potato 2
  * aloe 2

1600
  Got another water still set up.

1630
  Started cooking another large crab.

1830
  Done cooking.  Sun is down now, picked up palm tops while waiting for crab.
  Tomorrow, get garden totally watered then replenish gear.

2330
  I've got all the palm fronds gathered next to the water stills.  The gardens
  are half watered.  Palm saplings should be ready in about 12 hours.
  Tomorrow, I'll wander the island picking up stuff while I wait.  I'll mark
  new islands, too.

Day 66 - Bat Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0430
  I've noticed a tight ring of low-flying bats behind camp.  Maybe this will be Bat Island.

# Measurements
* 100 - Tire Island
* 320 - far, boats, lots of shrubs/rocks (next island)

1230
  Saplings are ready to harvest, but I'm burning up.  If there is some more
  aloe, I'll use it and get a move on.  It's only been 23 hours since I planted
  the aloe, but there is some laying around.

1300
  harvest palm saplings

1630
  harvest complete - 3.5 hours

1800
  All gardens are finally watered.
  If pigs respawn, I'd better kill those out there now.  There is no point in
  keeping them around.  If those giant crabs respawn, I suppose I can kill them
  too, easily enough.  It's the snakes I want to avoid coming back.
  I've started harvesting the dead animals.  Continue this.

Day 67 - Bat Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0100
  Done harvesting animals, left the snake.  Time to get the rocks.

0315
  Done cleaning up and getting rocks.  Only got about 12.  Things are pretty
  stable now.  Time to prep for the next island.


0515
  I'm making all the tools I need.  Very easy now that I'm all set up.  I have
  some hides, but I need leather.  Time to make a tanning rack.

0630
  I just noticed I still have sunblock.  How long ago did I do that?  1230
    yesterday.  I'll try and spot when it runs out.
  I missed an island.


1030
  There's a tiger shark near the shore I tossed a couple spears in.  I'm going
  to try and finish him off with the spear gun.
  Sunblock is gone.
  My kura and potato are ready.

1300
  I can't find my shark, but now I've got a lot of spear guns spears.  I'm
    going to chill in the shade for a bit.  Maybe next time I'll make my camp in the shade.
  The rest of the garden is ready to harvest.  1 potato, 2 aloe, 1 quwawa.  I think we have enough potato, so I'm going to swap one out with quwawa.
  Bah.  It used up all the water in the garden when I cleared it.


2030
  I built a bird snare.  Not sure where to place it, as I haven't been paying
    attention.  I don't need the meat, just did it for the hell of it.
  I've got so much lumber here, I'm going to make a shade hut on the beach tonight.


0810
  I've got a pretty decent shack now.  Turns out you can destroy the things you
  build and reclaim the parts.  I just used up my advanced hammer, though.  :(

1630
  I shot like 5 spears into a shark plus a few wooden spears.  Didn't die.  I explored the boat on the other side of the island while I was waiting.  A shark finally appeared at the end.  Do they  come out mostly at dawn and dusk?
  Palm saplings are ready.  Will do that in the morning.


2030
  I don't know why I'm waiting until morning to harvest.  I can see fine now.

Day 68 - Bat Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0130
  Done harvesting.

Day 69 - Bat Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1300
  I went crazy and killed a shark off the coast.  It took 5 spears and an axe.
    I need more.  How many shots does it take?
  I'm going to rest up and then go out and kill another one.

## Launch Checklist
  * x 2 cheap hammers
  * x 1 hoe
  * x 2 refined axes
  * x 4 lashings
  * x 2 aloe potions
  * x water bladder (full)
  * bed
  * compass in hand

1500
  harvested 2 potatoes, 2 quwawa, 1 aloe

1600
  I have lots of potatos, but I want fruit.  I'm going to change one of the
    gardens from potato to kura.
  When I leave, I have 10 slots.  All I need in my hands is my compass.  This
  isn't a monster game.  I can find a spot to land and pull out my crates
  before getting attacked.
  How many crates do I need?

## Crates
* tools made
* tools found
* seeds food
* seeds util
* navigation
* supplies
* potions

Each crate has 5 slots.

I've got 11 spear gun arrows stacked.

2100
I've built a loom.  May as well build some cloth while I have all this fiber.

Day 70 - Bat Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0200
  I've created another crate for the boat motor.  If I can make that, I can
  remove the sail.  I'll need to make fuel, though, so this is a long term
  project.  It's 2 AM now, but I'm going to head back to Rice Island and see if
  I have the missing filter.

0400
  Landed on Rice Island
  Oh, good.  Two large crabs are back, attacking me.  I saw the corpse from an
  old one, so I guess that doesn't keep the from respawning.

0700
  Leaving Rice, back to Bat.

0830
  Arrived on Bat Island.

0930
  I have not finished exploring the wreckage around the island.  I'm going to
    do that now and hunt a shark if I can.

1445
  Got a hammerhead, but it got me too.  Time to count the arrows.
  It took 8 arrows.  Dang.
  Took 3 to take down a small boar.
  I learned flare gunes have only 2 shots.  They light everything up, though.
  Going counter clockwise, I've made it to 20deg clearing wreckage.

2245
  I'm going to build a new boat with bouy base and metal floor.  I can't use the engine yet, but I could try destroying the boat to see if I can reclaim the materials.

Day 71 - Bat Island
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0600
  Done harvesting palm saplings.

  The crabs are spawning again!

1130
  Done kiling two crabs and 1 boar.  They took 1 week to respawn.

1300
  Harvested another kura

2130
  I harvested the rest of my plants.  I'm going to take the cot and go hit the next island.
